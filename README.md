# Pixel-Chess
Kansas State University Game Design course final project. Functional, pixel art recreation of chess. Soundtrack is entirely self-composed. 

Click on a piece to select it, and click on a destination to move it. Rules are self-imposed: any piece can be moved anywhere. 

Art and music created from scratch.
